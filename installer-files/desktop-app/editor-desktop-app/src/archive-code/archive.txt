1. All the files in archive-code include code that was not yet properly implemented, but 
still of use. The first entry into this folder is code relating to authentication via 
Google.

I was able to setup authentication via email credentials with Firebase, but
not quite with Google. So, I decided to put the useEffect hook responsible for
checking if a user authenticated via google in this folder.  Once, I am can properly
implement the login via Google process, I will reinstate the useEffect hook.
The Google Button code will stay as a component because its aesthetic is finalized.
I just won't put the Google Button on the page. because the actual functionality of 
signing in via google isn't properly implemented.
