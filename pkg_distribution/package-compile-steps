<---- This command creates .pkg for the script file ----->
<---First, we create a single executable script which compiles all the files
<--- in da-vinci-script into a single executable called script with the below command

pyinstaller --onefile --distpath installer-files/da-vinci-script/dist installer-files/da-vinci-script/script.py

<---We also create a file GameTime.py which is a python file wrapper of script detectable by Da Vinci. The user will only see GameTime in Scripts--->

<--- With these 2 files in /dist, we run the pkg command. This installs at system level /tmp/ai-editor_temp ---->
<---  When the user downloads, the post-install script puts the script in Fusion/Scripts/Utility/ --->
pkgbuild --root installer-files/da-vinci-script/dist \
--install-location "/tmp/ai-editor_temp" \
--identifier com.company_name.script \
--version 1.0 \
--ownership recommended \
--scripts installer-files/da-vinci-script/post_install \
script.pkg

<--THIS IS NOW OUTDATED BECUASE WE HAVE A NEW GUI>
<--- The GUI is a Tauri Application, so deployment is a bit different.
<--- First compile the App executable with:

      npm run tauri build

<--- This Creates the MacOS bundle in:
      src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/GameTime.app

<--- That is the only file put inside gui.pkg

<---- Now create the .pkg file for the GUIAPP file by targeting GameTime.app------>
<-- NOTE: we simply put the 

pkgbuild --root installer-files/desktop-app/editor-desktop-app/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos \
--install-location "/Applications" \
--identifier com.gametime.guiapp \
--version 1.0 \
--ownership recommended \
guiapp.pkg

<----- This command createss the .pkg file for the config file ------>

pkgbuild --root installer-files/Support-Files/dist \
--install-location "/tmp/ai-config" \
--identifier com.gametime.supportfiles \
--version 1.0 \
--ownership recommended \
--scripts installer-files/Support-Files/post_install \
support.pkg

<--- NOTE!!, the user will see GameTime in all spots but the Application Support Directory, that we created is currently called AI-Video-Editor.

<----- This final command combines all 3 above .pkg files into 1 pkg for distribution ---->
<-- Note that package-path flag gets all .pkg files in the current directory -->
<-- Resources gets any extra files from the installer_files directory -->
<--- For now this works, final_installer.pkg gets created and running the download works --->
<--- I will have to make the installer look nicer in the future but it works --->

productbuild --distribution pkg_distribution/distribution.xml \
  --package-path . \
  --resources ./installer-files \
  GameTime.pkg
