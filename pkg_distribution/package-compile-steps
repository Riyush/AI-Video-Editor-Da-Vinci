<--- Now. I simply plug all logic into a main folder directory that gets seperately installed in the root /Library/Application Support/Gametime directory. We need to ensure that this folder is accessible to the script which is in the Fusion
Scripts folder--->

<---We create a file GameTime.py which is a python file designed to call the main logic in another location on user's computer in simple python. The user will only see GameTime in:
~/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Fusion/Scripts/Utility 
From this location, the user can call the script from DaVinci Resolve Scripts Folder

<--- We designed GameTime.py to simply create resolve and fusion objects and make a call to the  main_logic directory which actually edits the timeline. The entrypoint to this editing logic is the script.py file which creates a socket to communicate with the GUI --->

<--- With these 2 components in /dist, we run the pkg command. This installs at system level /tmp/ai-editor_temp ---->
<---  When the user downloads, the post-install script puts the script in Fusion/Scripts/Utility/ and the main_logic directory in:
/Library/Application Support/Gametime     --->

pkgbuild --root installer-files/da-vinci-script/dist \
--install-location "/tmp/ai-editor_temp" \
--identifier com.company_name.script \
--version 1.0 \
--ownership recommended \
--scripts installer-files/da-vinci-script/post_install \
script.pkg

<--- The GUI is a Tauri Application, so deployment is a bit different.
<--- First compile the App executable with:

      npm run tauri build

<--- This Creates the MacOS bundle in:
      src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/GameTime.app

<--- That is the only file put inside gui.pkg

<--- Note, it also creates a dmg.sh file which might be useful if I want to package thie application as a dmg instead of a .pkg --->

<---- Now create the .pkg file for the GUIAPP file by targeting GameTime.app------>
<-- NOTE: we simply put the 

pkgbuild --root installer-files/desktop-app/editor-desktop-app/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos \
--install-location "/Applications" \
--identifier com.gametime.guiapp \
--version 1.0 \
--ownership recommended \
guiapp.pkg

<----- This command createss the .pkg file for the config file ------>

pkgbuild --root installer-files/Support-Files/dist \
--install-location "/tmp/ai-config" \
--identifier com.gametime.supportfiles \
--version 1.0 \
--ownership recommended \
--scripts installer-files/Support-Files/post_install \
support.pkg

<--- NOTE!!, the user will see GameTime in all spots but the Application Support Directory, that we created is currently called AI-Video-Editor.

<----- This final command combines all 3 above .pkg files into 1 pkg for distribution ---->
<-- Note that package-path flag gets all .pkg files in the current directory -->
<-- Resources gets any extra files from the installer_files directory -->
<--- For now this works, final_installer.pkg gets created and running the download works --->
<--- I will have to make the installer look nicer in the future but it works --->

productbuild --distribution pkg_distribution/distribution.xml \
  --package-path . \
  --resources ./installer-files \
  GameTime.pkg
